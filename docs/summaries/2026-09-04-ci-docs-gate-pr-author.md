# Session: Docs gate on PR author

**Branch:** ci/docs-gate-pr-author
**Date:** 2026-09-04 local (2026-09-04 UTC)

## Prompts
1. "can you review and merge this https://github.com/Tatendaz/langchain-fde-curriculum/pull/9"
2. "change it pr author and just merge it"
3. "same fix on the other repos too if they dont already have it use subagetns for each repo"

## Steps taken
- Branched `ci/docs-gate-pr-author` from `origin/main`.
- Swapped the docs-gate `if:` from `github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'` to `github.event.pull_request.user.login != 'dependabot[bot]'`, keeping this repo's existing `pull_request` event guard, and updated the comment above it.
- Added this summary and the matching `docs/features/` entry.
- Opened the PR from this branch against `main`.

## Decisions
- **Author, not actor.** The PR author is fixed for the life of the PR; the actor changes with every "Update branch" click or manual push (a re-run keeps the original actor and only sets `github.triggering_actor`).
- **No per-repo CodeRabbit review.** The identical diff was reviewed clean centrally on langchain-fde-curriculum #11, following the dependabot-auto-merge rollout precedent.
